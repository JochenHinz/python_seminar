    "### The next data structures we'll discuss are `dict`s and `set`s.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### Both are `mutable`, meaning we can add elements to them at runtime.\n",
    "### What many people don't realize is that their underlying data structures are quite similar—\n",
    "### both are based on a `hash table`, something we'll discuss in greater detail at the end of **lecture 1**.\n",
    "### Many other programming languages refer to them as `hashmap` (for `dict`) and `hashset` (for `set`).\n",
    "### \n",
    "### The key difference is that a `dict` (or `hashmap`) stores `key-value` pairs,\n",
    "### whereas a `set` (or `hashset`) stores only unique `key`s.\n",
    "### Internally, Python’s `set` works similarly to a `dict` but only tracks keys, not associated values.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### Both data structures provide **very fast lookups** due to their use of hash tables.\n",
    "### The average lookup time is **amortized $\\mathcal{O}(1)$**, meaning that while individual lookups\n",

    "### and therefore cannot be indexed into. They are very useful for instance when you wanna keep track\n",

    "# <u>Lesson 3</u>: Comprehensions\n",
    "###\n",
    "### Since Python is an interpreted language, `for` loops are slower than in compiled languages.\n",
    "### But why exactly is that?\n",
    "###\n",
    "### Consider the following loop:\n",
    "###\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "N = 2500\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers_squared = []\n",
    "for i in range(N):\n",
    "    numbers_squared.append(i**2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "###\n",
    "### At first glance, we might expect this to be as expensive as squaring `N == 2500` integers.\n",
    "### However, Python’s dynamic nature introduces several additional steps per iteration:\n",
    "###\n",
    "### 1. The `for` loop requests the next number from `range(N)`, calling `__next__()` on the iterator.\n",
    "### 2. Python retrieves `i` and confirms it is an `int` (implicit type tracking).\n",
    "### 3. The expression `i**2` triggers a method lookup for `int.__pow__`.\n",
    "### 4. If `i**2` is a small integer, Python reuses a cached value; otherwise, a new integer object is allocated.\n",
    "### 5. Python looks up `numbers_squared.append` (method resolution).\n",
    "### 6. The new integer is appended to the list, which may trigger **resizing** (if capacity is exceeded).\n",
    "### 7. If resizing occurs:\n",
    "###    - A **new larger memory block** is allocated.\n",
    "###    - Existing elements are **copied over**.\n",
    "###    - The old block is **marked for garbage collection**.\n",
    "### 8. The interpreter processes **each bytecode instruction**, introducing additional overhead.\n",
    "###\n",
    "### In contrast, a compiled language like C would execute just one machine instruction for `i**2`\n",
    "### and use a **preallocated** array, avoiding all dynamic lookups and memory resizing.\n",
    "###\n",
    "### Because of Python's dynamic execution model, the actual runtime of a loop is often \n",
    "### 10-100 times slower than an equivalent compiled C implementation.\n",
    "### However, the **asymptotic complexity** remains $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, since the number of operations \n",
    "### still grows linearly with the input size.\n",
    "###\n",
    "### We will learn in lesson 3 how you can achieve `C`-like performance also in `Python` under\n",
    "### the right circumstances and the use of the right tools.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### In what follows, we will discuss `comprehension`s. They have two main advantages:\n",
    "### \n",
    "### 1. They're often more readable.\n",
    "### 2. They are a tad faster because they allow `Python` to skip a few of the above steps.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### One optimization that `comprehension`s enable is avoiding `resizing` because `Python`\n",
    "### can often determine the outcome's number of elements before entering the loop,\n",
    "### thus allowing for preallocation of a container with the right size.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### The speedup is limited, however, and amounts to an average of about $15-20$%:"

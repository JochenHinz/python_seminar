   - (Direct and indirect) Inheriting from numpy.ndarray. Compatibility with numpy.ufunc's and broadcasting
   - Creative uses of Context Managers
  
3. The best of two worlds: fast and readable Python
   - Advanced Numpy concepts
   - Writing a parallelised Python code
   - Using Numba for JIT compilation
